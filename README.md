# Horn development project
The code were used in our manuscript, including our single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data processing. 

##snRNA-seq analysis
The code folders divided by stages of samples mainly include the following processes:
  1. quality control
  2. cell type annotation
  3. differential expression genes analysis between horn and skin tissues at Day 100
  4. trajectory analysis of neural cells

##snATAC-seq analysis
The code mainly includes the following processes:
  1. cellranger pipeline
  2. quality control and cell type annotation
  3. construct gene regulatory networks of neural cells and fibroblasts

##spatial transcriptomic data analysis
The code mainly includes the following process:
cell type annotation of horn tissues at Day 150
